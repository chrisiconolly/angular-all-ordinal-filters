Angual ordinal filters
===========

Project background
------------

I've started this project as I couldn't find an angular filter which provided me with what I needed for another project. The following stackoverflow (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13627308/add-st-nd-rd-and-th-ordinal-suffix-to-a-number) page has multiple different functions to create get an ordinal value for a given number.

I decided to take these solutions write tests and measure their performance, the winner would then be the base for what I needed.
